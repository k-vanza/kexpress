there are two types of js
common in which require statements are used
module in which import ststement are used

we use axios to handle data between the frontend and backend 
we can use fetch but axios gives more functionality
-----

Now if I want to not declare the whole http then i us eproxiy mening an alias
now to do so just go yo vite confifg and write the following:

server: {
    proxy:{
      '/api' : 'http://localhost:3000'
    }
  },

it is a key value pair 

In backend we have get listen and port
